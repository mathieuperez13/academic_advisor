Introduction to Microeconomics
Term: Fall 2020
Instructor: Dr. Anne Duchene

Course Description:
Welcome to Econ 001! This is an introductory undergraduate course that teaches the fundamentals of micro-
economics. Microeconomics is the study of how individuals, households, rms and governments make choices,
and how these choices aect prices, the allocation of resources and the well-being of all agents. The course will
be divided in 4 sections:
1. Section I: We will start with an introduction to core principles, followed by the market forces of supply
and demand. Then we will then delve behind the demand curve to see how consumers behave, and behind
the supply curve to see how producers behave, culminating in the model of perfect competition.
2. Section II: The second section will be focused on government intervention in perfectly competitive markets.
3. Section III: We will then study market failures, such as externalities, public goods, and market power.
4. Section IV: We will end the semester studying the market for labor and economic inequality.

Course Structure:
1. Lectures (asynchronous): all lectures will be delivered via short videos embedded in reading assignments
(in the e-book described in section 3). Every week you will have to complete reading assignments and
watch these videos, but you can do that whenever you wish before the weekly deadline (not necessarily
during lecture time).
2. Recitations (synchronous): we will divide recitation sections in half to create smaller groups, and you will
meet with your TA every other week in recitation (on Zoom).
3. Oce hours (synchronous):
â€¢ Every other week when you don't have recitation, you will meet informally with your TA during
Zoom oce hours. Your TA will arrange their oce hours to t your schedule.
â€¢ I will hold 3 synchronous oce hours and 1 asynchronous Q&A session on Zoom every week.

Required Materials:
3.1
For reading assignments and lecture videos:
â€¢ We will use the custom-built e-book "Principles of Economics" on Top Hat (ISBN: 978-1-77330-093-1).
Don't worry if you don't see any content in the course right away, I will make it available to you as we
progress through the semester. Embedded in this text are short lecture videos as well as multiple choice
questions pertaining to the readings, which will be factored into your overall grade for the course.

â€¢ When setting up your account, you MUST use your Penn ID(@upenn.edu) email address. Using an other
email address will result in you receiving NO credit for the Top Hat homework. An email invitation will
be sent to you by email and will be posted on Canvas. If you select the one-semester subscription option,
you will be charged a total of $71 by Top Hat. You can also buy access cards from the Penn bookstore,
but subject to a price mark-up. If you run into any problems signing for Top Hat or gaining access to the
course, email support@tophat.com.
3.2
For communications:
â€¢ We will use Canvas to post announcements, reminders, course material, grades, and for discussion boards.
â€¢ On a daily basis, we will communicate through the (free) Slate add-in to your Top Hat site, or the Slate
Top Hat app. Slate will have direct communication between the Econ 1 team and the students, and also
between students. An email will be sent at the beginning of the semester on how to join Slate from Top
Hat.
â€¢ We will use Zoom for oce hours and recitations.
â€¢ E-mail may also be used if you have more personal questions: econ-001@sas.upenn.edu

At the end of the semester, there will be a maximum of 110 cumulative points. To allow exibility, your
course grade will be 100% as long as you accrue at least 100 points. If you accrue less than 100 points, we will
keep your grade as is. If you accumulate more than 100 points, good for you! Nonetheless, the maximum credit
is 100 points. The nal average/letter grade scale is:
â€¢ A+/A/A- range: 97% to 100% / 93% to 96.9% / 90% to 92.9%
â€¢ B+ / B /B- range: 87% to 89.9% / 83% to 86.9% / 80% to 82.9%
â€¢ C+ / C / C- range: 77% to 79.9% / 73% to 76.9% / 70% to 72.9%
â€¢ D+ / D range: 67% to 69.9% / 60% to 66.9%
â€¢ F range: 59.9% and below.
Percentage course grades will not be curved nor rounded : 89.9% is a B+, a 79.9% is a C+, etc. If I feel that a
curve is necessary for the nal, it will announced on Canvas when exam grades are posted.

4.1
Homework
All due dates are on the last page of the syllabus. Given the generous grading (see part 4), we are strict with the
due dates, so you should not leave the submission to the last hour of the due date.
â€¢ Reading Assignments (with in-chapter questions):
 Due every Wednesday at 11:59PM EDT.
 Every week you will have reading assignments in the e-book. Within each reading assignment will be
embedded mini lecture videos and multiple choice questions that you will have to answer. Most of
the videos are edited from last year's lectures, in order to preserve the energy and atmosphere that
you would get in a classroom. Reading assignments will be available a week in advance.
 Grading: You will be graded on your completion of the questions, rather than the accuracy of your
answers. So you can take these assignments seriously and complete them as they are intended (to
help with your comprehension), or you can just fake your way through these assignmentsit's up
to you as an adult learner. There are a total of 480 questions (each worth 0.025 points), so these
questions are worth 12 completion points overall.
â€¢ Group Homework:
 Due every other Wednesday at 11:59PM EDT.
 Every other week, you will be grouped with 2 or 3 other students to work together on a problem set.
You will have to submit your answers as a group on Canvas 2 weeks later. You will be able to work as
a group in breakout rooms during recitation and oce hours. You should also use the recitation time
when you don't meet with your TA to meet with your group members. Keep in good communication
with your group members. If your name is left o of your group's homework, we will assume that
you didn't contribute, so you won't get any credit. So make sure you contribute, and make sure you
get credit for your contributions. These assignments will be posted two weeks before their due date.
Late homework will not be accepted.
 Grading: You will be graded based on eort, on a scale of 0 to 2 (0= not answered / not submitted
/ submitted late, 1 = some eort but incomplete, 2 = excellent eort). There will be a total of 6
group homeworks, worth 12 points overall.
4.2
Participation
â€¢ Canvas:
 Due at least every other week.
 We expect you to participate regularly on Canvas discussion boards (within your recitation section).
Here are two examples:
âˆ— At least every other week, we will ask you to nd a podcast or news article related to the previous
week's topics and post it on Canvas. This is meant to help you relate the theories we will study
to the real world.
âˆ— At the end of each section of the course, we will also ask you to describe a topic that you found
challenging in that section, and explain how you were able to overcome it.
 Grading: you will be graded on participation  full participation you will give you full credit (8
points), irregular participation will give you partial credit.

â€¢ Slate:
 Due at least once a week.
 Every week we expect you to post on Slate. These posts do not have to be related to the course
material! They are meant to build the Econ 1 community.
 Grading: you will be graded on participation  weekly participation you will give you full credit (3
points), irregular participation will give you partial credit.
4.3
Tests:
â€¢ Quizzes:
 24 hours window (from Sunday 11:59AM EDT to Monday 11:59AM EDT), timed for 30 minutes.
 At the end of each week, you will have a Canvas quiz on the week's topics. The quiz will have 3-4
multiple choice questions and 1 problem set (with ll-in the blanks questions).
 Grading: Each quiz will be worth 5 correctness points (50 points overall)
â€¢ Final exam:
 Date TBD. The exam will be timed (2 hours) with a 24-hour window to take it.
 The nal exam will be on Canvas, with about 10 multiple choice questions and about 5 (short)
short-answer questions.
 Grading: The nal exam will be worth 25 points.

How to succeed in Econ 001:
â€¢ Overall you should expect to spend about 8-10 hours per week studying for Econ 001. The key is regularity!
You should make sure you have a routine and study on a daily basis.
â€¢ On a typical week:
 Monday: do the reading assignment, watch the videos and answer the in-chapter questions. Try to
get the main ideas: what are the topics, what are the issues, and what are the main questions? What
will the graphs look like, what will the equations look like? What is the main message?
 Tuesday: start practicing for the quiz using old exam questions on the week's topics, and / or work
on your group homework. Go back to the textbook if you need to read it more carefully and in depth
(but do not try to memorize it!). Write down what seems unclear, keep it for oce hours or post a
question on the Canvas discussion board or on Slate.
 Wednesday: like Monday.
 Thursday / Friday: Attend recitation, keep working with your group mates.
 Saturday: practice for the quiz.
 Sunday: take the quiz.
â€¢ Throughout the semester:

Page 5:
ECON 001 Introduction to Microeconomics
Fall 2020
 Get feedback as soon as you can: look up answers to homework as soon as they are released. Ask me
or your TA if there is something you don't understand. The sooner you get the feedback, the more
solid the material will be in your mind.
 Take advantage of group homework to form a study group and make it a habit to meet at the same
time each week. You will learn a lot more if you are forced to explain things to classmates in your
own words. But always make sure that you try to answer the questions before you meet your study
partners. That way you will honestly know what you do and do not understand.
 Practice! There is nothing like solving more and more questions to get the hang of this stu. You
will be given a link to copies of Econ 001 old exams with solutions on Canvas. Make sure you work
them and fully understand them. However, do not memorize answers, it will be useless! When you
practice, you must think of what you are doing and why. We ask for analysis and critical thinking
on exams, not just memorization. You cannot succeed in Econ 001 if you are on auto-pilot.
 If you nd yourself falling behind, please reach out to us. We are here to help and we want you to
succeed!

Class Policy:
This syllabus is a contract. Deviation from these policies is not allowed.
6.1
Attendance
â€¢ While we expect you to attend recitations and oce hours, we understand that there may be enormous
extenuating circumstances that may prevent you from attending live sessions. If there is anything that
prevents you from attending synchronous meetings on a regular basis, please email your TA to let them
know. If you expect to be absent for ve days or less, you should use the Course Absence Report System.
â€¢ If you miss a recitation we expect you to contact your TA and the members of your group homework to
catch up.
6.2
Homework
â€¢ No late submission.
You have several days to submit each homework assignment; do not leave the
submission to the last hour of the last day that it is due.
â€¢ As mentioned above for group homework: Keep in good communication with your group members. If your
name is left o of your group's homework, we will assume that you didn't contribute, so you won't get any
credit.
â€¢ No extra credit: there is no extra credit in this course. The reason is that if everyone knows about it, it's
not really extra credit. It's just another assignment. If some people don't know about it (for instance, if a
specic student asks for extra credit at the end of the semester), then I'm treating my students dierently,
which I make every attempt to avoid.
6.3
Tests
â€¢ Tests (quizzes and nal exam) are open book, open notes.
â€¢ They are given under the rules of Penn's Honor system (see below)  we expect independent work.
