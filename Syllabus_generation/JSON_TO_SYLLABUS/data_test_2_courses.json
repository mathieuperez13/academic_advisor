In this course, students will be introduced to the IPython programming environment. They will learn how to gather data, store it in appropriate data structures and then either write their own functions or use libraries to analyze and then display the salient information in that data. Data will be drawn from a variety of domains, including but not limited to travel, entertainment, politics, economics, biology etc.","assessment_method":"Midterms","class_structure":{"Recitation":{"day":"Monday","time":"16:00-17:30","mandatory":false,"duration":1}},"Course Quality":1.82,"Instructor Rating":1.62,"Course Difficulty":1.87,"Work Required":1.65,"Category":"Engineering"}, 
{"title":"CIS 1070 Visual Culture through the Computer's Eye","semester":"Fall or Spring","prerequisites":"No prerequisites listed","course_unit":"1 Course Unit","info":"Visual studies and the humanities more generally have thought about and modeled seeing of artworks for many centuries. What useful tools can machine learning develop from databases of art historical images or other datasets of visual culture? Can tools from machine learning help visual studies ask new questions? When put together, what can these fields teach us about visual learning, its pathways, its underlying assumptions, and the effects of its archives/datasets? Class project teams will ideally be composed of both humanities majors and engineering majors who will develop datasets and/or ask important questions of datasets, in addition to thinking and writing more generally about how computer vision could help in teaching and analyzing visual art. We are looking for a variety of students from different majors and schools to bring their diverse skill sets to the course. No programming knowledge is required. The course offers an example-based introduction to machine learning, so no prior knowledge of machine learning is required.","assessment_method":"Weekly tests","class_structure":{"Lecture":{"day":"Monday","time":"14:00-15:30","mandatory":true,"duration":2},"Lab":{"day":"Thursday","time":"08:00-09:30","mandatory":true,"duration":3}},"Course Quality":1.71,"Instructor Rating":1.65,"Course Difficulty":1.66,"Work Required":1.59,"Category":"General Electives"}]
